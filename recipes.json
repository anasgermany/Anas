      "Start by preparing your blueberry topping, as it can simmer while making the pancake batter. In a small saucepan over low heat, add the frozen blueberries and agave nectar and cover with a lid. If you are using fresh blueberries, add about a tablespoon of water.  After about 3 minutes, checks on the blueberries  once juices begin to seep out, add the cinnamon and stir well.  Cover again and continue to heat blueberries for about 10 to 15 minutes, checking occasionally.  The topping is ready when the juices formed are syrupy and the blueberries are plump and hot.  If youre looking for thick syrup, simply mash the blueberries with a fork while they are cooking in the saucepan.  This time, I kept the blueberries whole. Once ready, remove from heat and leave the cover on to keep warm.While blueberries are on the stove, prepare pancake batter.  In a mixing bowl, combine all wet ingredients and beat together.",
      "Add the coconut flour, baking powder and salt and continue to mix until all clumps are smoothed out and youre left with a very thick batter.  If you are using a mixer, you might need to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to get the coconut flour fully integrated. Allow batter to sit for about 5 minutes.",
      "Heat a large skillet on medium-low. Once warm, spread a dollop of butter evenly over the skillet.  Using a spoon or rubber spatula, portion out about a third of the batter and shape it into a pancake on the skillet.  Coconut flour pancakes need to be manipulated more than the standard all-purpose flour pancakes, as coconut flour tends to hold its shape.  (Note: If your pancakes begin to melt around the edges, it is because there is not enough coconut flour in your batch.",
      "Add more coconut flour a teaspoon at a time until the batter stays together on the skillet.)Repeat this step for the remaining 2/3 of the batter (this recipe makes 3 medium-sized pancakes), giving each pancake plenty of space for flipping. Allow pancakes to sit on the skillet for about 7 to 10 minutes. Carefully work a large spatula under each pancake and gently flip (it is easy to break coconut pancakes, so the flipping process is the most difficult part about this recipe).  Allow the pancakes to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes then remove from heat.Top pancakes with the blueberry topping and confectioners sugar. If you are looking for more sweetness: drizzle agave nectar, honey or pure maple syrup over the tops of the cakes."
